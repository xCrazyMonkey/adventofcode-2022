# adventofcode-2022
This repository contains code I have written for the Advent of Code 2022 event.

The programming language of choice is Javascript, because I have little experience coding in JS and therefore would like to familiarize myself with it.

I am sharing this code to showcase my work and methods of approach for each challenge of the Advent of Code challenge.
If you have any feedback or questions regarding my work, feel free to approach me.
